# ECommerce Store (Title undecided)
- This is a 3 week 2-person team project building an entire ecommerce web application using ASP.NET.

## About our ECommerce Store

### Our Products
- We sell high quality products that are divided into three different categories:
    1. Sound system
    2. Gadgets
    3. Bags

### Claims
- We used claims to save user's fullname, email, role, and subscription status. 
Fullname is utilized to display users name on anywhere on the website to provide welcoming feeling in 
their experience. 
Role claim is used to identify their access status allowing the access on certain pages for security reasons.
Lastly, we created subscription claim. Which it displays with special deals only for those of ones who are 
signed-up for the subscription list.

### Policies
- Currently we have two policies that are being enforced in our application:
    1. AdminOnly
        - Admin Only policy only allow access for users with admin status to enter certain parts of our application for security reasons.
    2. Subscriber
        - Subscriber policy only allow Subscribers to see sepcial deals we will be holding in the future.
        - Currently, this policy has not been yet implemented yet, but it will be in short future.

### OAuth
- We implemented connecting with Microsoft and Google OAuth. Which allows any Google or Microsoft account
holders will be able to signin through those accounts and still enjoy the experience with our application.
